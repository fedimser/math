    "*Dmytro Fedoriaka, July 2024*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In competitive programming it is common to do computations modulo a prime number $M$. It is convenient because one can define and efficiently compute an inverse modulo prime number (e.g. using formula $x^{-1} \\equiv x^{M-2} (\\text{mod} ~M))$. In other words, $\\mathbb{Z}_M$ is a field. So, one can do arithmetic pretty much like if these numbers are real numbers and get correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are other operations that are not well-defined in a field $\\mathbb{Z}_M$. In particular, a square root is not defined for all elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_M$. For example, there is no solutions to equation $x^2 = 3$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$, which means square roots of 3 is not defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do in this case when we still need to get square root for any number? Well, what we do for real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ when we want to extract square root of a negative number? We define a new symbol $i$ and say that by definition $i^2=1$, then add it to $\\mathbb{R}$ and also close new structure under all arithmetic operations (this construction is called a [field extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_extension)). As a result we get new field $\\mathbb{R}[i]=\\mathbb{C}$, which we call \"complex numbers\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I propose to do the same thing to a field of residuals modulo M. It turns out that resulting construction has some interesting properties. It is a field and it allows to extract square roots of any number from $\\mathbb{Z}_M$, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I will describe some properties of $\\mathbb{Z}_M$ and describe how to efficiently (in $O(poly(\\log M))$) compute roots of any degree in it, and order of any non-zero element. Finally, I will show a practical application of this constructions: solving cubic equations in $\\mathbb{Z}_M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note.** *I couldn't find literature explicitly describing properties $\\mathbb{Z}_M[i]$, but it's hard to believe it doesn't exist. So I didn't bother to give rigorous mathematical proofs (so far). Instead, I focused on describing interesting facts and providing explicit algorithms in Python. Also, my notation might be different from conventional.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $M$ be a prime number such that $M \\equiv 3 ~ (\\text{mod} ~ 4)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $\\mathbb{Z}_M$ - a field of residuals modulo $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $\\mathbb{Z}_M[i] = \\big \\{ a+b \\cdot i ~|~ a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_M \\big \\}$, where $i$ is such a symbol that by definition $i^2 = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "I call these \"Modular Gaussian Integers\", because these are like [Gaussian Integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integer) $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$, except their coefficients are from $\\mathbb{Z}_M$ instead of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Elementary operations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arithmetic operations** are defined the same way as for regular complex numbers $\\mathbb{C} = \\mathbb{R}[i]$. Note that coefficients are from $\\mathbb{Z}_M$, so it's assumed that all operations with coefficients are modulo M (e.g. when we write $ab$, we imply $(ab)\\%M$) .\n",
    "\n",
    "* Addition: $(a+b i) + (c+di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i$\n",
    "* Subtraction: $(a+b i) - (c+di) = (a+c) - (b+d)i$\n",
    "* Multiplication: $(a+b i) \\cdot (c+di) = (ac-bdc) - (ad+bc)i$\n",
    "* Division: $\\frac{a+bi}{c+di} = \\frac{(a+bi)(c-di)}{(c+di)(c-di)} = \\frac{(ac+bd) + (bc-ad)i}{c^2+d^2} = \n",
    "(ac+bd)\\cdot (c^2+d^2)^{-1} + (bc-ad) \\cdot (c^2+d^2)^{-1} \\cdot i $\n",
    "\n",
    "Division involves finding inverse of $(c^2+d^2)$ modulo $M$. So, $\\mathbb{Z}_M[i]$ is a field if and only if this inverse exists for any non-zero $c+d i$. This holds if and only if $M$ is prime and $M \\equiv 3 ~(\\text{mod}~ 4)$. See proof [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2160330/about-ring-of-gaussian-integers-modulo-n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, we can claim that:\n",
    "* $\\mathbb{Z}_M$ is a ring for any integer $M \\ge 2$.\n",
    "* $\\mathbb{Z}_M$ is a field if and only if $M$ is prime and $M \\equiv 3 ~(\\text{mod}~ 4)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exponentiation.** We can define $a^b$ as multiplying $a$ by itself $b$ times. This can be computed in $O(\\log M)$ using binary exponentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complex conjugate.** Define $\\overline{a+b i}= a-bi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modulus.** Define $|a+b i| = a^2+b^2 \\in Z_M$. Note that unlike in $\\mathbb{C}$, we **are not taking square root**, because it's not always possible in $Z_M$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to check that:\n",
    "  * $|x|=x \\cdot \\overline{x}$\n",
    "  * $|x| \\cdot |y| = |x \\cdot y|$\n",
    "  * $|x|=0 \\Leftrightarrow x=0$\n",
    "  * $|x/\\overline{x}|=|\\overline{x}/x|=1$ for any non-zero $x$."

We can write $x = \\omega_1 ^{n_1} \\cdot \\omega_2 ^{n_2}$, where $n_1 \\in [0, K), n_2 \\in [0,4(K+1)$. Using Chinese Remainder Theorem, now we can claim that:\n",
